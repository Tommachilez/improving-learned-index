## Doc2Query--

There is an issue with `pyterrier_doc2query` which prevents downloading and using
the [pre-computed queries generated by docT5query](https://huggingface.co/datasets/macavaney/d2q-msmarco-passage/tree/main)
and
[pre-computed ELECTRA scores](https://huggingface.co/datasets/macavaney/d2q-msmarco-passage-scores-electra/tree/main).

I have opened an issue in their
repo: [Issues with Fetching Queries/Scores from Store #9](https://github.com/terrierteam/pyterrier_doc2query/issues/9)

### Setup

For now, I manually introduce the setup of GIT LFS. Make sure to have [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com) installed.

Then, you can call the module itself directily as:

```bash
python -m doc2query-- \
  --collection /hdd1/home/soyuj/collection.tsv \
  --queries https://huggingface.co/datasets/macavaney/d2q-msmarco-passage \
  --scores https://huggingface.co/datasets/macavaney/d2q-msmarco-passage-scores-electra \
  --output /hdd1/home/soyuj/expanded_collection.tsv \
  --threshold 70 \
  --unique_terms_only
```
